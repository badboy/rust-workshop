# Getting started

First, install Rust on your computer.

Then create a new project with `cargo`

```console
~ $ cargo new workshop
```

This will generate two files: `Cargo.toml`, a metadata file for your project and `main.rs`, the main application entry points, containing some basic code

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World");
}
```
